      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s me, Bastian, a passionate software developer. I am mainly working with Rust to create services for the web. Next to that I am writing for several tech magazines and publish articles on my own. Every now and then I get interviewed as well.
My Open Source contributions can be found mostly at GitHub, whereas my own projects are hosted at sourcehut. A detailed CV with projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on is on my LinkedIn profile.</description>
