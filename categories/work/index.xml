      <description>Info: This article was written in December 2019, before the pandemic hit the world.
My personal biggest factor being a software developer is to be able to work at the cutting edge of technology + industries and generally think about how life should look like in 10 or 20 years from now.
One of the biggest aspects, at least in my opinion, will be how we see companies, jobs and our current system.</description>
