      <description>I have to admit, the power of IoT did not yet reach my little nerd life here in Berlin. Therefore, I took an effort this year and went to an IoT Hackathon. It was a fun weekend, I think there were just 5 developers and the rest of the crowd came from a social and educational background. Which made it even more fun and interesting.
Anyway, since this weekend I ordered a RaspberryPi and tried to do something useful with it.</description>
