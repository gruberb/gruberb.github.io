      <description>A few years ago, I wanted to make the switch from Frontend to Backend. One day I fell down the YouTube rabbit hole and (partly) watched a few tech talks. I realised that many of the really good talks were held at Clojure conferences. I looked into it, and decided to learn Clojure.
The lust for learning a new programming language often times comes from the sheer boredom of your old work, so you also want to redo part of yourself.</description>

      <description>Each system has its own believes and &amp;ldquo;common truths&amp;rdquo;. With system, I mean areas or professions. Education, Science, cooking etc. Each place where people come together and build a closed system where they operate in. From within, it&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to change a system, it&amp;rsquo;s just possible from the outside and by letting the old system die and create parallel to that a new one.
Programming is a system for me.</description>

      <description>I am a developer now for more than 10 years. Except a few years with SVN, I was solely working with Git. The best quote I got from one of my CTOs in the early days, was:
&amp;ldquo;Git is like the whole world, but we need just the size of a lake of it.&amp;rdquo;
You mainly use:
 git clone git pull git push git add git commit git checkout and git checkout -b  That&amp;rsquo;s mostly it, right?</description>
