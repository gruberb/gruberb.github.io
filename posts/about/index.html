<hr>
<p>That&rsquo;s me, Bastian, a passionate software developer. I am mainly working with Rust to create services for the web. Next to that I am writing for several tech magazines and publish articles on my own. Every now and then I get <a href="https://gruberbastian.com/posts/interviews">interviewed</a> as well.</p>
<p>My Open Source contributions can be found mostly at <a href="https://github.com/gruberb">GitHub</a>, whereas my own projects are hosted at <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~gruberb">sourcehut</a>. A detailed CV with projects I&rsquo;ve worked on is on my <a href="https://de.linkedin.com/in/bastiangruber">LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>

<p>I had a pleasure to work together with Bastian at Koerber Digital on an IOT application for tables providing analysis of operational data for large factories.
<br />
His knowledge of React and Redux was a great addition to our team and I always enjoyed sharing the knowledge and efforts to produce a great quality app. I think we both learned a lot from each other.</p>

<p>"I had the opportunity to work with Bastian on a client project and he has been an absolute pleasure to work with.
<br />
Besides his great technical and problem solving skills what stood out to me was his drive to build a great product for the end user and to help the team align.
<br />
Bastian has worked in several agile teams before and I could learn a lot from him.
<br />
He is up to date with the bleeding-edge in web development and shares his knowledge left and right. I would love to work with him again and would recommend anyone looking to hire him to not pass on the opportunity.
<br />
The project we worked on he mainly worked with: NodeJs, Angular, MaterialUI, Docker, MicroServices, RabbitMQ, MongoDB, AWS, ElasticSearch."</p>

  <p>"I had the chance to work with Bastian in Glispa in different projects. Whether it's HTML/CSS or Javascript, he's equally capable to both craft a state-of-the-art web project or to rework an existing one. He has a good critical sense, and he's capable of finding what's wrong on interfaces pointing his attention on both UX and UI. It was a pleasure to work with Bastian and I definitely recommend him if you have to make something nice and quickly."</p>

  <p>"I had the pleasure of working with Bastian at glispa, collaborating on several projects, including Voltu. I was totally impressed by his ability to juggle multiple projects, it was unlike any I’ve seen before and made a dramatic difference in the productivity and professional level of our team.
<p>As a person, Bastian has a bright entrepreneurial mindset. He shares his knowledge and constantly improves skills to build meaningful things.</p>
<p>Bastian would be a true asset to any team, because he is a talented, hard-working and warm co-worker! &ldquo;</p>

  <p>"I have had the great pleasure to work with Bastian at smartB long enough to say a couple of things about him. Bastian is curious and self-motivated. He'll find a way to do things better and improve quality. The challenge from a management perspective is keeping him continuously motivated. As an exceptional developer requires an exceptional management to make sure he is able to deliver software while being challenged to do so. Bastian is a problem solver and someone I would definitely pursue for any company I work for."</p>
