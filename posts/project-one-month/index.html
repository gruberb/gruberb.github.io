  <h1>Project: One month of focus [UPDATE]</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Mon, Oct 1, 2018</span>
  <p><em>Update: Since I wrote this blog post, created the second MeetUp for &ldquo;Rust and Tell&rdquo;, something unexpected happened: My daugther was born. Way too early (3 months), so instead of spending September in front of Rust code, I spend around 10 hours a day in the hospital. This being said: The project for October is: Don&rsquo;t have any plans ;)</em></p>
<p>The dilemma of our privilidged and comfortable lifes as software engineers is:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are always so many new things to get into and play around with</li>
<li>After playing around with them enough, there are thousnads possibilities to earn money with your new skills, or:</li>
<li>Join other people with the same interest and just have fun</li>
</ul>
<p>But also, it&rsquo;s insanely hard after a long day of work to get enough headspace. If you have kids, it&rsquo;s even &ldquo;harder&rdquo;. Though many will claim having a child and seeing it grow up in front of you is way more fun then the latest technology.</p>
<p><strong>As everything in life, it&rsquo;s a balance.</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, my aim is to shut off every distraction which is not needed and focus every month just on one thing. I will pick a technology and just focus on this one. Which means: Unsubscribe from every newsletter, don&rsquo;t read twitter and don&rsquo;t participate in other MeetUps or discussions. Pure focus.</p>
<p>Obviously you have to manage your income stream to help feeding yourself and your family. Therefore work is allowed ;)</p>
<h3 id="september-goal-getting-proficient-in-rust">September goal: Getting proficient in Rust</h3>
<p>So, the following month (September) I will focus solely on Rust. In this regards, I opened up a MeetUp format called <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Berlin/events/254194727/">&ldquo;Rust and Tell&rdquo;</a> in Berlin, which helps to remember enjoying this new language and hear people struggling and building projects with it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>The process so far:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I started the MeetUp format</li>
<li>I already worked throug around 1/3 of the Rust book</li>
<li>I try to participate as much as I can in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-net-web">Net Web working group</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I also want to use this blog more, so I will irregularly blog about the process.</p>
