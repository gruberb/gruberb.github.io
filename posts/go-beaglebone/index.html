  <h1>Get started with BeagleBone</h1>

<p>I have to admit, the power of IoT did not yet reach my little nerd life here in Berlin. Therefore, I took an effort this year and went to an IoT Hackathon. It was a fun weekend, I think there were just 5 developers and the rest of the crowd came from a social and educational background. Which made it even more fun and interesting.</p>
<p>Anyway, since this weekend I ordered a RaspberryPi and tried to do something useful with it. This idea, and my other habit of simplyfing my life clashed a little bit. So the RaspberryPi sat around for way too long with no real purpose. After browsing the internet though, I found an interesting <a href="https://blog.sayan.ee/bbb">post from Sayan who set up a BeagleBone board with Go</a>. After React, Go is one of the new technologies I really like. After reading the article, I ordered the BeagleBone Black Wireless and waited impatiently for it to arrive.</p>
<p>Finally there, I did around 4 hours of trial and error to finally figure out how this little board works and what I have to do. Mainly, I wanted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install Debian on it</li>
<li>Booting it without the need of a SD Card</li>
<li>Run a Go server or something useful on it</li>
</ul>
<p>At the Hackathon back then, I created a temperature and noise dashboard (<a href="https://github.com/gruberb/IoTHack16">code is on GitHub</a>). Maybe the BeagleBone could do the same for me at home?</p>
<p>During this simple steps, I bricked the device twice, found some old post in some forum how to rebuild it and now I have working BeagleBone Black Wireless. In addition, I installed my own Go server on it to access it without a USB connection.</p>
<h2 id="sane-howto-without-the-errors">Sane HowTo (without the errors)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Connect the BeagleBone with your Mac, wait until it&rsquo;s booted, and then open the newly mounted Volume. In it, you find two drivers for the Mac you need to install before you can continue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Afterwards, there is a &ldquo;Flasher&rdquo; version of Debian for the BBB. It will install the OS on the emmc of your board so you don&rsquo;t need the SD Card every time you boot. I had problems finding a proper &ldquo;Flash-Debian-EMMC-Version&rdquo;. I tried a bunch of different ones, but nothing seemed to work. So I recommend this image here:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>wget https://rcn-ee.com/rootfs/2017-03-09/flasher/BBB-eMMC-flasher-debian-8.7-console-armhf-2017-03-09-2gb.img.xz</code></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Download it, and then unarchive it with Unarchiver for Mac or 7zip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now use your Terminal to create a working SD Card with this image, or <a href="https://etcher.io">just use this tool</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>sudo dd if=BBB-eMMC-flasher-debian-7.5-2014-05-14-2gb.img of=/dev/disk2s1</code></p>
<p><img src="https://preview.ibb.co/b5mY6F/status.jpg" alt="WGET image"></p>
<p>To find out the name of the SD Card, insert it and execute:</p>
<p><code>df -h</code></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Power off your BeagleBone Black, unplugg the power/usb cord, and insert the SD Card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold down the S2 button, and while holding it down, plug the power/usb cable in.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://preview.ibb.co/bt7Ufa/s2.jpg" alt="S2 Button BeagleBone"></p>
<ul>
<li>The LEDs need to light up at least once, afterwards you can release the S2 button again.</li>
</ul>
<p>CRITICAL: This step didn&rsquo;t work for me in a long time. What I did was to find the right image, and during this process plug the BeagleBone onto a power outlet and NOT via the USB cable in the Mac.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The LEDS are doing now some crazy things, lighting up in order 1-2-3-4-3-2-1-2&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system is shutting itself down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plug the BeagleBone back to your Mac, wait until it&rsquo;s booted, and then look at the right IP address in the network settings of your Mac.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the Terminal and execute this command (with the right IP address)
<code>ssh debian@192.168.6.2</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The password is <code>tmppwd</code> and can be changed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Voil√†, you have a working BeagleBone Black Wireless!</p>
